# Datavyu 1.3.6 Release Notes
## 4/3/2017

### New Features
* Highlight and focus mode

and red when the playback timer is past a cell.

not at the current playback time.
* Quick key mode

alphanumeric key, a cell will be added to that column at the current time
with the first code filled in with the key that you pressed.

* Default OSX media player is now based on AVFoundation instead of QTKit,
improves performance and allows GPU acceleration

### Bug Fixes

# Announcements
## 1/20/2015

* Yosemite no longer supports Java QuickTime and so Datavyu is not curently compatible. We apologize for the inconvenience     and advise our users to be aware of the situation before deciding to upgrade to Yosemite.

* If you try to download Datavyu and receive a pop up saying: "Datavyu is damaged and should be moved to the trash," please    check your security settings to allow the download of the software. Please go to System Preferences/Security/General tab     and then check "Allow apps to be downloaded from: anywhere."

* Can't seem to hold down jog while navigating your video? All you have to do is go to your Terminal (found in your Hard       Drive/Applications/Utilities folder) and enter the following: defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

# Datavyu 1.1 Release Notes
## 03/10/2014

### Additions
* Created more prompts to save to prevent accidental data loss.
* Minimizing the spreadsheet window will minimize all Datavyu windows.

### Changes
* The names of some software features were changed to adhere to a more intuitive naming scheme:
    * "Vocab Editor" --> "Code Editor"
    * "Observation" --> "Cell"
    * "Argument" --> "Code"
    * "Temporal Ordering" --> "Temporal Alignment"
    * "Variable" --> "Column"
    * "Data Viewer" --> "Media Player"
    * "Data Viewer Controller" --> "Controller"
* Quicktime 7.7.5 no longer includes java libraries, but you can easily include them in your download. For new installs and for Quicktime updates, please follow the steps provided on the [installation page](http://www.datavyu.org/user-guide/_images/install-quicktime-special.png).
* The [Controller](http://www.datavyu.org/user-guide/_images/keypad-add-data-button.png) has a new format that is no standard between PC and Mac keyboards.
* Users are now restricted to Matrix-style columns. Text and nominal columns can no longer be created but pre-existing instances from saved files are still supported. Since it is now the only type of column, matrices are now referred to simply as columns.
* Restrictions on column names have been enforced to prevent problems in the scripting interface.
    * Column names must begin with a letter.
    * Only letters, numbers and underscores are allowed in column names.
    * Previously created columns that do not adhere to these restrictions will continue to work, but new column names (or name changes) will be restricted.
    * We have provided a script in favorites folder that will turn periods into underscores in existing columns to aid the transition.
* Datavyu is no longer uses Mongo DB. Eliminating this outside dependency means:
    * Datavyu is less memory intensive.
    * The Datavyu application is smaller.
    * Startup and file loading are faster.
    * Errors when closing Datavyu on Windows machines have been fixed.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed issues causing cells to overlap when temporal alignment is turned on.
* When running scripts, more informative status messages are printed to the console window.
* You no longer have to scroll when you code a long spreadsheet.
* Column location in the spreadsheet is saved.
* Hide/Show columns list is saved.

### Known Issues
* The arrow keys do not always allow you to move from code to code in the code editor and spreadsheet but the tab and shift tab keys have the same function.
* Undo history is not always accurate.
* You can click, hold down, and drag a code name within a cell but it does not influence the code itself and it does not save. Please save your file and reopen it.
* Occasionally, running a script will produce no output when in fact, the script did work.
* The changed file marker (*) doesn't always disappear on save.
* VLC cannot accurately determine frame rates of our videos and thus is unsupported in Datavyu.




# Datavyu 1.04rev3 Release Notes
## 12/11/2013

### Additions
* Added file association support in Mac and Windows. Double-clicking on a .opf file will now open the file in Datavyu.

### Changes
* "Variables" have been renamed "columns" and "matrix arguments" have been renamed "codes" throughout the user interface.
* All API functions have been renamed to use the words "column" and "code", however, API functions using the old naming scheme will continue to work so that scripts do not need to be revised.
* Scripts now allow the user to overwrite an existing column. Previously, trying to set a column back to the spreadsheet caused an error if the columns shared the same name.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue with Datavyu failing to close completely (preventing the user from being able to reopen the program).
* Corrected a case where setting the offset of a cell changed the offset of the previous cell in a column
* Fixed the create\_mutually\_exclusive script to correct an error where the final cell was not written to the spreadsheet.
* Fixed a bug that was preventing output from being written to the scripting console.
* Improved video playback performance issues on Windows and Mac.

### Known Issues
  * In some cases, the asterisk in the title bar indicating that changes have been made to the file may not appear/disappear correctly
  * Hidden variables may be listed as shown in the variable list
  * Temporal alignment displays cells incorrectly in rare cases
  * Windows will not correctly handle opening a file by double clicking it once Datavyu is already open.

### Bug Fixes
  * Fixed change_arg and make_rel functions in the scripting API
